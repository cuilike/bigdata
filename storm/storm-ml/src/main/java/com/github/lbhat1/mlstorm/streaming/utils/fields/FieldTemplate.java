/**
 * Field template is a key interface in MlStorm to define the Storm stream fields and the feature vectors.
 * It helps to consistently name the fields across topologies and streams.
 * <p/>
 * Every tuple in the top level Storm stream must consist of a key and a feature vector.
 * The merged streams can have arbitrary names, but the standard names are constants in this interface.
 * <p/>
 * The runtime feature count is setup by the MlStormSpout to which this FieldTemplate is injected.
 * The same field template is "passed around" in the entire topology. This will ensure all bolts
 * and operators know exactly what fields and features to expect.
